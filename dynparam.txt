kT_multiplier:	2.0	# used to calculate kT; kT = kT_multiplier * stdev of scores
mutation_rate:	0.25	# probability that each gene will mutate at each step
mutation_size:	0.75	# stdev of the stochastic size of mutation
n_conserve:	10	# number of best individuals kept unmutated in each step
parental_skew:	0.75	# amount inherited from one parent; 1 means no recombination
population_size:	30	# size of population
